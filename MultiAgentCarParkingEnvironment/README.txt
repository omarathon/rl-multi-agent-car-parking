Notes:
	- MultiAgentCarParkingEnvironment comes with a neural network model attached to the CarAgents. Remove the neural network attached to the Car prefab before building if intending to train (and also set the appropriate initMode of the EnvironmentManager).
	- Scripts/Logger in the scene should be enabled if one requires a logger within play mode.
