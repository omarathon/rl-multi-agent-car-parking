This directory contains the datasets for each PPO experiment (indexed by the corresponding figure in the report).

Each dataset is a CSV file (spreadsheet), with column headers the environment parameters in the PPO YAML file that were varied and the obtained important metrics. The metrics are ordered such that the metrics shown in the graphs/figures come first, followed by the auxiliary metrics.
